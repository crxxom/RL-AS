# Performance of Reinforcement Learning Methods under the Avellaneda Stoikov Theoretical Market Making Framwork

This repository contains the full implementation of the simulated experiments for the project.

All experiments ran are contained in the experiment folder. To rerun a particular experiment, put all the files under the experiment to the project root directory and change the config.py to match the desire settings.

Run `python main.py` to first conduct relavent trainings and then `python simulation.py` to perform monte carlo simulation on the AS environment.
